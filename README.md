# Project Description

This project utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict stock prices. It fetches historical stock price data for individual stocks like Google (GOOGL) from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses the data, and trains an LSTM model to make future price predictions. The model is evaluated using actual stock prices and the predicted values are plotted to visualize the performance. The code demonstrates how LSTM networks can be used for stock price prediction and provides an example for implementing deep learning techniques in financial forecasting.

# Usage

Make sure you have Yahoo Finance API installed. Run the script and change the stock_symbol variable to any stock who's price you would like to predict. After the model has finished training, it will print out a plot comparing the actual vs. predicted prices.

# Example
